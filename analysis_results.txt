## Final Answer from Gemini
That's a highly debated topic with no definitive answer! However, **Sir Donald Bradman** is widely considered the greatest batsman of all time due to his unparalleled Test batting average of 99.94. Other strong contenders often mentioned include:

*   **Sachin Tendulkar:** Holds numerous batting records across both Test and ODI formats and is revered for his longevity and impact.
*   **Sir Garfield Sobers:** A phenomenal all-rounder, excelling in batting, bowling (pace and spin), and fielding.
*   **Shane Warne:** Arguably the greatest leg-spinner of all time, with a transformative influence on the game.
*   **Muttiah Muralitharan:** Highest wicket taker in both Tests and ODIs.

Ultimately, the "best" depends on individual criteria and priorities (e.g., stats, impact, versatility, longevity).
